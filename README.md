### Focus areas


### Recommended certifications
<br/>
There are many certifications available to software engineers, below are some of the few we strongly recommend as your start your journey:
<br/>
<br/>

#### **AWS**

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Having an understanding in some cloud computing basics is highly valuable as most companies have transitioned or are on their way to using cloud computing infrastructure as opposed to on-premises hardware.

#### - [AWS Solutions Architect (Associate)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
<br/>
<br/>

#### **Linux**

The linux kernel and subsystems are key to software development as the vast majority of containers, servers and Virtual Machines (VM's) will use some form of linux as a base system. Having a brief understanding of commands and scripting in this can be highly beneficial.
